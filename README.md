# AR-basic-survey
AR basic survey project allows surveyors to survey land using their smartphones, this will eliminate the use of dumpy level and levelling staff. a virtual levelling staff has been provided and smartphone can be used as a dumpy level. 
google cloudanchors project was used to share AR with multiple devices. device 1 will be installed to tripod and readings are taken from device 1, whereas device 2 can be moved around to place virtual staff in AR scene at any point. raycast from the centter of device 1 screen intersects with the levelling staff to get the readings
coordinate system of survey is to be followed instead of chain system.
